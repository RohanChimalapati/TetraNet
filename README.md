# Project TetraNet

Project TetraNet is a novel research method used for wildfire mitigation and wind-level prediction using footage from rapid nanosatellite deployment into space. It utilizes computer vision models, image segmenation U-Net convolutional networks, and mathematical fire spread models and simulators in order to accurately apply wildfire patterns in a real-world setting, allowing researchers to predict future trends.
