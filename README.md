Project TetraNet is a novel research project used for wildfire mitigation and wind-level prediction using footage from rapid nanosatellite deployment into space. It utilizes computer vision models, image segmentation U-Net convolutional networks, linear regression artifical neural networks, and mathematical fire spread simulators in order to accurately apply wildfire patterns to a real-world setting, allowing researchers to prevent wildfires from spreading in high-risk regions.

The above image was annotated using Apeer to produce the image below. All of our images were obtained through our original footage from our launch to space in 2021. We trained the image segmentation U-Net convolution networks using all of these annotated Apeer images.
