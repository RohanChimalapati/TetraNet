# Project TetraNet

Project TetraNet is a novel research method used for wildfire mitigation and wind-level prediction using footage from rapid nanosatellite deployment into space. It utilizes computer vision models, image segmentation U-Net convolutional networks, and mathematical fire spread simulators in order to accurately apply wildfire patterns to a real-world setting, allowing researchers to prevent wildfires from spreading in high-risk regions.
